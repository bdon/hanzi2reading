## Design goals
* Annotation of Chinese characters with Standard Mandarin (國語/普通話）readings
* Should work offline - database format should be as compact as possible
* Should support word-based disambiguation of characters with multiple readings
* separation of code and data - phrase backend should be swappable
* Word segmentation is a non-goal
